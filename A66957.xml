            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe the Doctrines of the Church are, as by ſome wittingly miſ-related, ſo by many others ignorantly miſtaken; the Author thought it might be uſeful for the informing of thoſe, who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from profeſſing Truth, only becauſe they do not know it, not becauſe they hate it, or prefer ſome ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt before it, to draw up ſome brief Catholick <hi>Theſes,</hi> as well negative as affirmative, extending to moſt of the principal Points of Controverſy between the Roman and Reformed Churches. In which <hi>Theſes</hi> he Profeſſeth, 1 That there is not any thing wittingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that is affirmed by any allowed Council. 2 Nor any thing affirmed that is in any ſuch Council denied. Nor 3 any thing affirmed or denied here, but what, if not in Council, yet in ſome Catholick Writers (uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Church) may be ſhewed to be ſo; and all to be bounded within ſuch a Latitude of Opinion, as the Church indulgeth. For the more evidencing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch Propoſitions, as he conjectured might be, by ſome leſs read and experienced, any way doubted of, whether acknowledged and received by Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, He hath confirmed, either with the Teſtimonies of approved Catholick Divines, or (which might have more weight with ſome Readers) the Conceſſions of Learned Proteſtants; leaving only ſo many of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:37764:2"/>
               <hi>Theſes</hi> unguarded, as he preſumed their own Perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would ſecure. But here 1 The Author pretends not, that all is comprehended in theſe <hi>Theſes</hi> which hath been delivered by Councils in all theſe Points, becauſe this he thought both too tedious a Task, and needleſs; ſince the main Points are here compriſed; and the intelligent Reader will diſcern, That many of thoſe omitted may be readily inferred by neceſſary conſequence from thoſe here expreſſed; and ſince he, who in theſe concurs with the Church's Judgment, muſt needs ſo much reverence it, as eaſily in the reſt to reſign himſelf to it. Nor 2 doth he pretend, that no Catholick Author of good eſteem delivers the contrary to any Propoſition here ſet down (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch of them as have not been the Determinations of Councils): For the Church herein allows a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Opinions; and he thought it ſufficient to his Purpoſe to ſhew, that none, to be eſteemed true Sons of the Church Catholick, and right Profeſſors of her Faith, need to be of any other Perſwaſion then this here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; and not that all are, or muſt be of it. And ſtrange it were, for any on this account only to deſert the Church, becauſe he can produce ſome perſons in it that hold a thing he conceives falſe or unreaſonable; whilſt the ſame Mother indulgeth him to hold only that which he thinks rational and true. For any therefore to gather a Body of ſuch Teſtimonies (except thoſe of Councils) againſt any of theſe <hi>Theſes</hi> is labour loſt; ſo long as he cannot produce ſome obligation laid upon all to conform to ſuch Opinions, or follow ſuch a Party; and ſo long as the Church equally ſpreads her lap to all thoſe who think, or ſay, otherwiſe. Nay further, could he produce ſome Catholick Author of good repute affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary to ſomething here ſaid, to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Faith of the Church, or ſomething here ſaid to
<pb facs="tcp:37764:2"/>be contrary to it; yet neither is this conceived to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs his ſaying it is ſo, proves it to be ſo. For a learned Author, poſſibly, for the greater reputation of his Doctrine, may be too facile to entitle the Church to it, either as ſuppoſing it deducible, by ſome neceſſary conſequence, from ſome Decree thereof; or as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the words of ſuch a Decree to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſe, than the Council intended them; or indeed had light, either from Scripture, or Tradition Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, preciſely to determine; and ſometimes ſo it hath hapned, that contrary opinions have both of them urged the ſame Church Decree (couched only in more general Expreſſions) as deciding the Controverſy, their own way. But it is here reaſonably deſired; That ſuch Conciliary Decree it ſelf be produced and well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and thoſe Authors put in the other Scale who are here ſhewed to maintain, that to be well conſiſtent with, or alſo to be the Church's Doctrine, which ſome others perhaps may pronounce contrary to it. It not being the Author's Deſign in this Collection to ſhew that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks agree in all things here ſaid, but that none, to be true Roman Catholicks need to hold or ſay, any thing otherwiſe. By this to remove out of the way that great Scandal and Stumbling-block of well-inclined, but miſ-informed Proteſtants, who apprehend, that ſuch groſs Errors in Faith and Manners, as no ſober and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Chriſtian can with a good Conſcience ſubſcribe, are not only held and tolerated in the Roman Church, but alſo by it impoſed. The Author hath alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in theſe <hi>Theſes</hi> to deſcend ſo far to ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars and circumſtantials, as that the intelligent may eaſily diſcern them applicable to the ſolution of moſt doubts ſuch as are material; and to the explanation of his meaning, where to ſome Readers ſeeming am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
<pb facs="tcp:37764:3"/>or obſcure; and they may ſerve them for a Comment or Expoſition on moſt he hath written; wherein his principal Deſign hath ever been (Truth always preſerved) Unity, and the Peace of the Church of God: a deſign which can never be compleated whilſt new Writings ſtill ſucceed the former, till by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy theſe preſent Diſſenſions arrive unto their juſt period.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That ſuch Promiſes belong to the Church Catholick as a Guide.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this indefectibility of the Church as a Guide doth extend to an inerrability, as in all Fundamentals (in which if it errs it is no more a Church:) So in all other points, the contrary Tenents to which are dangerous to Salvation: For there ſeemeth to be no reaſonable ground of a Reſtraint of our Saviour's Promiſes (made indefinitely) narrower then this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Amongſt the ſeveral ways whereby the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick may deliver her Judgment as a Guide (whether by Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, Communicatory Letters, or Councils) that conſent

               <p n="5">5. That therefore no inferior, or ſubordinate Perſon, or Synod, when they are known to oppoſe this Supreme, may be taken by particular Perſons for their Guide in Spiritual matters.</p>

Nor yet a minor part of the Fathers, in theſe ſupreme Councils, differing from the reſt, or out of theſe Councils, a minor part of Chriſtian Churches oppoſing the reſt, may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as our Guide: For ſo, notwithſtanding theſe Guides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us, we are left in the ſame uncertainty for our way, as if we had none, except only when all of them unanimouſly agree; and if, of two parties oppoſite, it is left to us to chooſe which we will, to guide us, it is all one for thoſe points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe differ, as if we were left to guide our ſelves.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Concerning the Church Catholick of ſeveral Ages her being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually this Guide.</note>1. IT is affirmed: That the Church Catholick of every Age, ſince the Apoſtles, and conſequently the Church Catholick of this preſent Age, hath the ſame indefectibility in Truth, and authority in Goverment, as that of any other; (Both theſe [Indefectibility and Authority] being as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the preſerving of Chriſtianity in one Age as in another) and that our Saviour's Promiſe of Indefectibility is made good to the Church Catholick of every Age taken diſtinctly. Elſe his Promiſe that the Church of all Ages ſhould not fail would ſufficiently be verified, if that of any one Age hath not failed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence it is gathered; That the preſent Catholick Church of any Age can never deliver any thing contrary to the Church of former Ages, in neceſſary matters of Faith or Manners.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37764:4"/>
3. Suppoſing that in matters not ſo neceſſary, the Catholick Church of ſeveral Ages ſhould differ; yet that the former having no more Promiſe of not erring herein then the later, therefore a Chriſtian hath no greater ſecurity of the not erring of the one, then of the other; and therefore ought to acquieſce in the Judgment of the preſent, under whoſe regency and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance God hath actually placed him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If for the performance of Chriſtian Obedience there be any neceſſity to have ſuch Points, as theſe firſt decided, <hi>viz.</hi> What former Councils have been lawful and obliging, and what unlawful? What are fundamental and neceſſary Points of Faith, and what not neceſſary? What is the Doctrine of the Ancient Church in ſuch and ſuch Controverſies? And what is the true ſenſe of the Fathers Writings, or of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Decree? If theſe, I ſay, (or ſo far as theſe) are neceſſary to be known by him; it follows that in theſe, a Chriſtian ought alſo to ſubmit to the Reſolutions of the preſent Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, ſo far as it hath or ſhall decide them unto him (<hi>i. e.</hi> to the Reſolution of the ſupremeſt Authority thereof, that he can arrive to) and herein to acquieſce. For thus far he is ſecure, that in things neceſſary ſhe cannot miſguide him. And it ſeems unreaſonable; That when ſhe is appointed his unfailable Guide in all Points neceſſary (See <hi>Num.</hi> 1. <hi>Head.</hi> 1.) He, not ſhe ſhould undertake to judge what Points are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and what not; for this is in effect to chooſe himſelf, in what particular Points ſhe ſhall guide him, and in what not? Unreaſonable, when he is obliged to obey her Councils, that He, not ſhe, ſhould decide of thoſe Councils which are lawful, and ought to be owned by her; for this is in effect to chooſe what Councils he pleaſeth, to command his obedience, and exclude the reſt. Unreaſonable, when he is to learn of her what is the Doctrine and true Senſe of the Holy Scriptures, that He, not ſhe ſhould judge what is the Doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or the true ſenſe of former Fathers, or Councils, and wherein the preſent Church accords with, or departs from, them; <hi>i. e.</hi> that ſhe, that is his Judge in greater Matters, may not be ſo in the leſs.</p>

Catholicks concede the holy Scriptures to contain all thoſe Points of Faith, that are ſimply neceſſary by all perſons to be believed for attaining Salvation: α to contain them, either in the concluſion it ſelf, or in the Principles, from which it is neceſſarily deduced. And contend that out of the Revelations made in the Scriptures, as expounded by former Tradition, the Church from time to time defines all ſuch points; except it be ſuch Practicals, wherein the queſtion is only, whether they be lawful; for the deciding of which lawfulneſs, it is enough if it can be ſhewed that nothing in Scripture, as underſtood by Antiquity, is repugnant to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

So the Arian Churches of the fifth Age

Neither, can any ſuch Perſon ſo intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, tho he be validly ordained, juſtly exerciſe ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdictions; neither do all ſuch people, as know, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſalvifical benefit by, his unlawful adminiſtration to them of the Church's Sacraments, or, at leaſt, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, and Abſolution, by reaſon of a defect of a

So, had <hi>Novatianus,</hi> ordained and adhered to by three, or four Biſhops, been upon this ſetled by a Chriſtian Emperor in the Apoſtolick Chair againſt <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ordained and confirmed in theſe Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by all the reſt of the Body of the Roman Epiſcopal Clergy; yet <hi>Novatianus</hi> would, no leſs for this, have been ſtill a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and an Uſurper.</p>

Hence alſo, ſhould a Chriſtian Secular Power (ſuppoſe, Arian) refuſe to nominate, and preſent any perſon to the Clergy to be admitted to ſuch Office and Juriſdictions within his dominions, ſave ſuch as are Arians, here the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, authorized by the Canons, ought to take the ſame care for theſe Chriſtian Provinces in ſuch dominions in the times of Chriſtian, as they did in times of Heathen Princes; in appointing ſuch other Paſtors over the Flocks of Chriſt there, as will ſtill preſerve the Faith and Unity of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.

It ſeems evident from Antiquity, as likewiſe confeſſed by learned Proteſtants; that, as the Biſhops could not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, in any Dioceſs, a lawful Spiritual Juriſdiction, without the Metropolitans Licence, and Confirmation; ſo neither could the Metropolitan, in any Province, without that of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch γ.

And therefore, anciently theſe Metropolitans obtained alſo the conſent of their Co-Metropolitans in other Provinces, by the <hi>Literae Communicatoriae,</hi> or <hi>formatae</hi> of thoſe Biſhops, upon the ſending to them a Copy of their Faith (according as it was ſetled, and profeſſed in the ſeveral Articles thereof, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to Hereſies in thoſe preſent times) and a Teſtimonial of their legitimate Election. Which alſo may be ſaid of the Patriarchs themſelves; who upon their ſending the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Informations, received a Confirmation from the Primate of them, the Roman Biſhop, and the other Co-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.</p>

To which was uſually added alſo the Communicatory Letters of other Patriarchs and Primates, upon his profeſſing to them if, need were, the Catholick Faith of his Anceſtors, and the legalneſs of his Election. And if, in latter times, the manner of his Inveſtiture with this Supreme Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Juriſdiction be not altogether the ſame; yet ſince we find in all ages a major part of Chriſtian Churches (ſuch as are guilty of no ancient condemned Hereſy) adhering to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Biſhop, and Faith, when as, meanwhile, ſeveral of the other Patriarchs have been condemned for Hereticks; we may preſume alſo, that not only the Clergy of the Roman Province, but all, or at leaſt a major part of, the Governors of theſe Churches are and have been, from age to age, ready to afford the ſame Teſtimony to his juſt, and Canonical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

Where he mentions alſo ſome of the former Canons. <q>The fourth Canon (ſaith he) of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> requireth that all Biſhops be ordained by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Biſhops of the Province <hi>[ſi fieri poteſt]</hi> which Council becauſe it cannot always be had, therefore it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, [there] That two or three may do the work the reſt conſenting and authorizing the Proceeding. And this is that which the ordinance of the Apoſtles hath provided to keep the viſible Communion of the whole Church in Unity. But when among the Biſhops of any Province, part conſent to Ordination, part not; the Unity of the Church cannot be preſerved unleſs the conſent of the whole follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the greater part. And therefore; It ſeemeth that there can no valid Ordination be made, where the greater number of the Biſhops of the Province diſſent; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Ordination of <hi>Novatianus</hi> for Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> which tho done by three Biſhops, yet was the foundation of that great Schiſme, becauſe <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ordained on the other ſide by ſixteen.</q>

After which in Application of theſe things to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, made in the Church <hi>England</hi> at the Reformation, he hath this Reflection, <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 250. <q>Now it is manifeſt (ſaith he) that the Ordinations by which that Order (of Biſhops) is propagated in <hi>England</hi> at, and ſince, the Reformation, were not made by conſent of the greater part of the Biſhops of each Province, but againſt their mind tho they made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Ordinations. And by the ſame means it is manifeſt, that all thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Laws, by which the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> by theſe new Biſhops were not made by a conſent capable to oblige the Church, if we ſet aſide the Secular Power that gave force unto that which was done [by the Biſhops] contrary to that Rule wherein the Unity of the Church conſiſteth. But in other parts the Reformation was ſo far from being done by Biſhops and Presbyters, or any conſent which was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Church, by the conſtitution of the Church, that the very Order of Biſhops is laid aſide and forgot, if not worſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> deteſted among them. Upon which precedent it ſounds plauſibly with the greateſt part among us: that the Unity of the whole being [thus] diſſolved by the Reformation [<hi>i. e.</hi> by the Reformers either being againſt Biſhops, or being Biſhops made againſt the conſent of the former Biſhops] the Unity of the Reformation cannot be preſerved, but by diſſolving the Order of Biſhops among us.</q> The like he ſaith before, <hi>p.</hi> 248. <q>If the Clergy of that time [<hi>i. e.</hi> in the beginning of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reformation] had been ſupported in that Power which by the Premiſes [ſet down and juſtified in his Book] is challenged on behalf of the Clergy, this Reformation could not have been brought to paſs.</q>

And therefore it is by all reſolved on: That the Church hath her Guides and Rulers diſtinct from them that bear the Sword, and that there is in the Church a Power of convocating theſe her Spiritual Paſtors to conſult of things concerning her welfare, tho none of the Princes of the world do favour her. And <hi>p.</hi> 81. Touching Errors of Faith, or Oberrations in the performance of God's worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (ſaith he); There is no queſtion but that Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, to whom it pertaineth to teach the Truth, are the ordinary and fitteſt Judges; and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily and regularly Princes are to leave the judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto them. And below, We do not attribute to our Princes, with their Civil Eſtates, power newly to adjudge any thing to be Hereſy without the concurrence of the State of their Clergy; but only to judge, in thoſe matters of Faith that are reſolved on, [<hi>i. e.</hi> in former Councils.] according to former reſolutions.</q> And the ſame much what is ſaid by Dr. <hi>Heylin, Reformation Justified,</hi> p. 80, 81. in affirming, <q>That if the Reformation be in ſuch Points of Doctrine, as have not been before defined in ſuch manner [<hi>i. e.</hi> in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, or in a particular Council univerſally received] The King only with a few of his Biſhops and learned Clergy, tho never ſo well ſtudied in the Point diſputed, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it.</q> That belongs only to the whole Body of the Clergy in their Convocation, rightly called and conſtituted. [By theſe Expreſſions the Reformation, allowed to Chriſtian Princes, ſeems only of Errors, firſt declared ſuch, either by the Reſolutions of former lawful Councils, or of a new law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Council of Clergy firſt had; which will eaſily be granted them. Provided that Councils be underſtood in their due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinations, and according to their due votes; not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of ſome inferior Synod preferred by ſuch Prince to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37764:20"/>Decree of a Superior, nor the vote of a Minor part in a Synod (or of ſome Clergy out of it) before that of a Major part, But if they mean, the Princes taking the Guidance of ſome Council againſt a Superior, or of ſome part of the Clergy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a Major, this is only deluding the Reader, and in effect granting nothing.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>29</label> For the firſt of theſe, It is an Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, or a Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters, which the Church hath never denied to belong to Secular Princes, but as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to them for it, and many Acts thereof may be, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have been, performed even by Princes Heathen, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical.

But ſuppoſe the Chriſtian Prince to be alſo Catholick, yet the limitations of ſeveral of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Authors ſeem hardly to allow him any ſuch Branches of Supremacy. For touching Errors of Faith, or Aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the performance of God's worſhip and ſervice, Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> before §. 20. ſaith, That ordinarily and regularly Princes are to leave the judgment thereof to the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, and in theſe things to judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their former reſolutions; or in any new matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no former Definition hath been made, the Prince (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> before §. 20.) is to follow the new Reſolutions that ſhall be made not of ſome few, tho never ſo learned, but of the whole body of his Clergy, and by conſequence to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo, not that, but the Reſolution of a higher Body of Clergy, if this oppoſe that of his Clergy; the one being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſubordinate to, and concluſive by, the other for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Unity and Peace of the Catholick Church.

That ſhould the Prince forbid it, yet the Church ſtill ought to uſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power therein, that ſhall be neceſſary to preſerve the Unity of the Church [of which neceſſity alſo they, not the Prince, are by our Lord conſtituted the Judges.] The like ſaith Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> of the Subordination of inferior Clergy to their Superiors, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; All this is true: 1.

We acknowledge that Biſhops were always eſteemed the proper Judges of the Canons both for compoſing of them, and for executing of them, but with this caution; That to make them Laws the Confirmation of the Prince was required; and to give the Biſhop a Coactive Power to execute them, The Prince's Grant or Conceſſion was needful.</q> 2. That the Church Canons are not of force at all, when theſe Canons relate to any civil Right, without the ſecular Magiſtrate's precedent admiſſion of them, of whoſe proper Cognizance ſuch Rights are. But meanwhile all Eccleſiaſtical Canons, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Faith or Government and Diſcipline of the Church, ſo far as they do not encroach on any ſuch civil Rights (as I preſume all thoſe made by the Church when under Heathen Governors will be granted to be) are in force, in whatever Princes Dominions, ſo as to render all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient liable to the Church's Cenſures, tho the Chriſtian Prince never ſo much oppoſe and reject them. And this granted, more is not deſired; for thus no Members of the Church at any time can be free from the ſtrict obſervance of ſuch Canons by any ſecular Authority or Patronage.</p>

Inſtitution as to ſome other, extending only to a part of the Church: and thus may have limited Juriſdiction (as to Place) for the one, unlimited for the other, without any Contradiction. As alſo the ſame Perſon hath the ſubordinate Juriſdictions of a Biſhop (and alſo in ſome poor Biſhopricks of the Rector of a Pariſh too) of a Metropolitan, and of a Primate, all well conſiſting. So one may be by a Prince made Governour of a whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in reſpect of ſome command which he hath over it all; and may be made by the ſame King, or by any other, to whom the King hath given the beſtowing of ſuch a Dignity, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour alſo of one City in that Province, in reſpect of ſome other Offices, diverſe from the former; which Offices he may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37764:35"/>over that Town only, and not likewiſe over the Province. Next ſuppoſe the Popes claim of the univerſal Paſtor-ſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; he cannot ceaſe thereby to be what he is, becauſe he claimeth ſomething more than he is; no more to be Patriarch ſtill, than to be Metropolitan or Primate ſtill: nor can the Obedience Canonically due to him as ſuch, be with-held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on a wrong Title he claims ſomewhat more not due, or ſome other way abuſeth his Office: No more then a Prince's Oppreſſions, or other miſdemeanors diſcharge their Subjects Allegiance.</p>
               <p>To Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> The univerſal Paſtor-ſhip and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch-ſhip are not one, but two Rights; and ſomething held by the Patriarch-ſhip over the Weſt, which is not by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over the whole Church. But were it otherwiſe, the ſame Right may be held by many Tenures. A Kingdome by Inheritance; and by Conqueſt, ſuppoſing Conqueſt a Good Title againſt an Heir when theſe two are in ſeveral perſons: A parcel of Land by Donation, and by Purchaſe. By many Tenures I ſay, ſo that as long as theſe are inherent in the ſame perſon, when one is judged to fail, the right may be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by another; and ſo that no other can diſpoſſeſs ſuch perſon, unleſs he prove not one, but all his titles faulty.</p>

Nor would the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Biſhops have forborn to have pleaded this Title, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this Council being called after the precedent, that is urg'd of <hi>Valentinian</hi> touching <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and in his days, yet ſuch Right of the Emperor the Eaſtern Biſhops do not pretend to at all; But in their Epiſtle to <hi>Leo</hi> earneſtly requeſt his conſent, uſing this as one argument to obtain it. <hi>Sic enim &amp; pii Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> [the two Emperors <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi>] <hi>compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebunt, quae tanquam legem tuae Sanctitatis Judicium firmave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> And the Emperors Preſidents in the Council do, <hi>Act.</hi> 16th, leave the diſpoſal thereof wholly in the Councils hands, and to be directed by the former Church Canons: Where <hi>Conc. Nic.</hi> 6. <hi>Mos antiquus obtineat,</hi> is ſtrongly pleaded by the Roman Legates and alſo afterward by <hi>Leo,</hi> which voids both <hi>Justinjan</hi>'s and <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s, or any other Emperors Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Roman Biſhops former Juriſdictions further then his conſent is obtained therein.</p>
               <p>Again: Since Heathen Princes have the ſame Title with Chriſtian to all Civil Rights, neither could the Church, when under them, have lawfully practiced ſuch a Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or elſe Princes muſt claim it as a thing conceded to them by the Church, to change and alter ſuch Subordinations. Now any ſuch Conceſſion from the Church we find not: but this we find in the 8th <hi>General Council,</hi> 21. <hi>c.

But if this originally a Civil Right, the Church hath uſurped their Power in her making Conſtitutions concerning it.]</p>

               <p>In the two laſt; the Prince changing or erecting a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropole, or Mother City for the Seat of Judicature, the Church, not the Prince (and ſo this proves no Right of his to do it.) orders, with very good reaſon, the change of the Seat of the Metropolitan to this Place of greateſt Concourſe. Theſe Canons, then, which the Dr. urgeth for his Cauſe, are they not to good purpoſe for the contrary? I pray you view them.

               <p>But <hi>3ly,</hi> they maintain; that all ſuch Diviſion wherein a particular perſon, or Church departs from the whole, or wherein a Subordinate Perſon or Church from all their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Superiors for ſuch matters wherein Obedience is required from them by all theſe, or by the whole; is ſuch Schiſme, as renders them no longer any part of the Church Catholick; nor Members of the Body of Chriſt.</p>

As the <hi>Arian</hi> Churches agreeing in all other Credends, ſave Conſubſtantiallity of God the Son with the Father, became, by this no longer a part of the Church
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37764:41"/>Catholick. 2.

Who profeſs themſelves not to renounce an inward Communion with thoſe departed from: 3. Who renounce not external Communion neither, if they may be admitted thereto on terms they can approve: 4.

Again they conclude from hence, that thoſe, who refuſe to conform to ſomething, which the Church Catholick requires of them, that they may be Partakers of her external Communion, and for this are by her thruſt out of her Communion, are guilty of Schiſm, as well as thoſe who before any Ejection voluntarily deſert it. Elſe <hi>Arians,</hi> and many other Hereticks would have been no Schiſmaticks. 4.

                  <note place="margin">Concerning the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcovery of Hereſy and Schiſm.</note> 1. CAtholicks affirm: That all maintaining of any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent contrary to the known Determination of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt judgment of the Church, in matters which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of neceſſary Faith, is guilty of obſtinacy, and ſo is Hereſy. Likewiſe, that all voluntary departure from the external Communion of the Church Catholick, upon what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſoever of its erring, in faith or manners, is truly cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; (the Catholick Church being our Guide in Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as to both what is true, and what is lawful, to whom we ought to aſſent and ſubmit) and ſo Schiſme.</p>
               <p>But <hi>2ly,</hi> taking the Proteſtant Deſcription of them: <hi>viz.</hi> That Hereſy is an obſtinate Defence of Error, contrary to a neceſſary Article of Faith: and Schiſm a cauſleſs Departure, or Separation from the external Catholick Communion, and ſo alſo (being cauſleſs) from the internal; Yet Catholicks urge this as neceſſary; that there muſt be ſome certain Judge upon Earth authorized to decide whether ſuch Error be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt neceſſary Faith; and whether the Defence thereof be to be interpreted obſtinacy; and whether ſuch Departure be cauſleſs. So that all the Subjects of the Church are to receive that to be Hereſy, or Schiſm, which this Judge pronounceth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37764:42"/>to be ſo. Elſe what none can know, and judge of, none can puniſh or ſeparate from; nor the true extent of the Church Catholick, and its Diſtinction from the Heretical and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, ever be diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is moſt reaſonable, that in any differences of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe, amongſt Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrates, or Courts of Judicature, the moſt ſupreme for the time being muſt be the Judge, to whom all ought to acquieſce. Elſe if a particular Perſon, or Church may undertake to judge theſe againſt Superiors, Hereſy and Schiſme will remain equally undiſcovered between theſe two contrary Judges, as if there were none; And Heretical and Schiſmatical Churches will ſtill free themſelves of it by their own Judgment; and that Perſon or Church, which contends for ſuch Priviledge at any time, gives great ſuſpition that they are in ſuch manner faulty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſeems clear, that all ſeparation of a particular Perſon or Church from the external Communion of all the reſt, will always by ſuch Judge either be pronounced <hi>cauſleſs,</hi> or the cauſe thereof be rectified; and ſo the Diviſion ceaſe, if theſe Churches that are departed from, be the Judges of it. For doubtleſs theſe, if they ſhould condemn themſelves, will alſo correct in themſelves what they do condemn.</p>

                  <hi>HEAD. XII.</hi> Concerning Submiſſion of Private Judgments to this Church-Authority indicated in the former Heads.</head>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Concerning Submiſſion of Private Judgments.</note> 1. IT is conceded by Catholicks, That no man can believe any thing at all, or do any thing lawfully, againſt his own judgment, or conſcience; as Judgment is taken here for the final Determination, upon reviewing the former Acts of the Intellect; and upon conſidering all reaſons (as well thoſe taken from <hi>Authority</hi> as thoſe taken from the <hi>things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) of what we ought to do.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:37764:42"/>
2. But notwithſtanding this, <hi>2ly,</hi> It is taken for granted, That one following his own judgment in believing, or acting, is not thereby ſecure from believing amiſs, or acting unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and therefore that every one is much obliged to take care of rectifying his Judgment, or directing aright his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſame Judgment may be ſwayed contrary ways by ſeveral Arguments: <hi>viz.</hi> One way from the Argument drawn from <hi>Authority,</hi> and another way from his <hi>private Reaſon:</hi> and that when this happens, he is no leſs truly ſaid to follow, and do according to, his own Judgment who judgeth it meet to follow Authority againſt his private Reaſon; then he who judgeth it meet, and ſo doth the contrary; <hi>i. e.</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own Reaſon, and reject Authority: or (which is the ſame) follow Authority meerly for the Reaſons it giveth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing to him ſuch a Truth. Thus we without difficulty believe the Books of Scripture, that are propoſed us for ſuch by ſufficient Authority, to be God's word; when we find in them ſome ſeeming contradictions, which perhaps our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reaſon cannot reconcile. And every one, who believes, that God hath commanded him an aſſent, and ſubmiſſion of Judgment in Spiritual matters to his Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, doth, in yielding it, follow his own Judgment, even when in yielding it, he goeth contrary to his own private Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is freely conceded, That ſuppoſing that one hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty of a thing from private Reaſon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way whatever, ſuch perſon cannot poſſibly yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of aſſent to any Authority whatever propoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be believed by him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But notwithſtanding, <hi>5ly,</hi> It is affirmed by Catholicks, That every one ought to yield aſſent, and ſubmit his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (even when by plauſible arguments of private Reaſon otherways biaſs'd and ſway'd) in all Spiritual matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch aſſent is required to the Authority of the Church, and thoſe Spiritual Superiors, who are by Chriſt appointed in theſe matters the Guides of his Faith. And alſo, That none can ever have, from private Reaſon, an infallible certainty of the contrary of that which the Church enjoins him to believe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſuppoſing, that ſuch a certainty in ſome Points by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37764:43"/>ſome perſons could be had; yet <hi>6ly,</hi> If no more may plead freedome from obedience of aſſent to the Church's Authority, than only thoſe, who pretend infallible certainty (as nothing leſs than this ſeems ſufficient to reject ſo great an Authority, and ſo divinely aſſiſted); then the moſt part of Chriſtians (I mean all the unlearned at leaſt, unfit to read Fathers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Texts of Scripture <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in matters controverted) will always be obliged to follow this Authority, tho againſt their private Reaſon. And, for the other, ſince one may think himſelf infallibly certain, who is not ſo, (for men of contrary opinions not unfrequently, both, plead it) theſe ſeem to have, as little humility, ſo little ſecurity, in relying thereon; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when, ſo many others, having the ſame Evidences, and, as theſe men ought to think, better Judgments, and having larger promiſes of Divine aſſiſtance, and laſtly, appointed for their Guides, ſhall apprehend ſo much certainty of, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the contrary.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To one who as yet doubteth whether there be any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or amongſt many pretending to it, which of them it is, to which God hath ſubjected him for the guidance of his Judgment in Spiritual matters, to ſuch a one the uſe of his private Reaſon, in the Queſt thereof, is not denyed by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. But 1ſt, they affirm that ſuch Guide being found, here the uſe of his private Reaſon againſt ſuch Authority ceaſeth for thoſe things, wherein he is enjoined obedience to it; which indeed are but few in compariſon of thoſe vaſt Volumes of Theological Controverſies, wherein private Judgment ſtill enjoys its liberty. <hi>2ly,</hi> That, if by reaſon of a faulty ſearch, ſuch Guide is not diſcovered by him, none is, therefore, held excuſed from obedience to ſuch Guide, or licenſed to uſe his liberty, in both which he is culpably miſtaken. <hi>3ly,</hi> That, as it is left to our reaſon to ſeek, ſo that it is much eaſier for us by it to find out, this <hi>Guide,</hi> that is appointed to direct us; than to find out the Truth of all thoſe things, wherein ſhe is ready to direct us: (more eaſy to find out the Church, than to underſtand all the Scriptures:) and that from the uſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reaſon in ſome things; none may therefore rationally claim it in all.</p>

IT is certain, that all Faith Divine, or wrought in us by God's Spirit, is infallible; or, that the Propoſition which is ſo believed never is, or can be falſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again Catholicks affirm; that the Authority, or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the Church, is a ſufficiently infallible ground of the Chriſtians belief for all neceſſary Points of Faith. From which Infallibility in the Church (which is clearly revealed in Scripture, and by Tradition Apoſtolical) delivering ſuch Points unto them, they alſo maintain, a firm Faith is had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Catholicks of all thoſe neceſſary Points which are not, in Scripture, or Tradition, as to all men, ſo clearly revealed.

               <p n="3">3. Catholicks affirm alſo, that a right Belief of ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith profiteth not, as to Salvation, perſons Heretical in ſome other. But <hi>4ly,</hi> many learned Catholicks deny, That a known Infallibility of the external Proponent or Motive of ones Faith [or a certainty, not from a firm adheſion of mind wrought by the Spirit, whereby <hi>a man is without all doubt,</hi> but from the Infallibility of the external means of his Faith, that he cannot err] is neceſſary, that Faith may be truly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Salvifical; See Card. <hi>Lugo, De Virtute fidei.

                     <hi>Next,</hi> Concerning the neceſſity of an explicite, or ſufficiency of an implicite, Faith.</head>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Concerning explicit, and implicite Faith.</note>1. It is freely acknowledged by Catholicks, that to <hi>ſome</hi> Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, an explicite or expreſs Faith, wherein the Article in its terms is particularly known, and profeſſed, is neceſſary to all Chriſtians, that have the uſe of reaſon; of what condition or calling ſoever. But to <hi>how many</hi> Articles ſuch Faith is neceſſary, it is not eaſy punctually to determine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Catholicks teach that all Chriſtians are obliged, by what means ſoever afforded them, to acquire an explicite Faith, of all other Articles of Faith, or Precepts of good Life, which are any way either neceſſary, or profitable to their Salvation, ſo far as their capacities, or callings do permit, or alſo require them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all Chriſtians ought in general, or implicitely, to believe; that whatever God hath revealed, or the Church in her Definitions, or Expoſitions of the Divine Revelations, delivereth as matter of Faith, and to be believed, is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and ought alſo to be ready explicitely to hold and profeſs whatever is at any time ſufficiently propoſed to them to be ſuch. And other implicite Faith, than the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is not allowed; nor other explicite Faith, than the forementioned required.</p>
                  <p>[Therefore that Propoſition <hi>[Haec eſt vera Catholica fides, extra quam nemo Salvus eſſe potest]</hi> as applied to the larger Creeds, that of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> or yet further, to all the Decrees of all lawful Oecumenical Councils, as in the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, ought either to be underſtood not diſtributively; as if any Decree of any ſuch Council unknown, and ſo not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or aſſented to, excludeth from Salvation: For, how few among Chriſtians do know, or yield actual aſſent to all the Decrees of ſome one Council? And how can the Doctors of that Church require ſuch Belief to all the Decrees, ſuppoſe, of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> a many of whom require it not to all the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed? But <hi>collectively,</hi> thus;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37764:44"/>That all that <hi>Fides extra quam nemo Salvus,</hi> is contained therein: and that <hi>extra eam totaliter ſumptam,</hi> or <hi>ſi tota deſit, nemo Salvus eſſe poteſt.</hi> As elſewhere, in the ſame Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is called. <hi>Fundamentum firmum, &amp;</hi> unicum <hi>contra quod portae inferi nunquam praevalebunt.</hi> Conc.

               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Concerning Obedience required to Humane Laws.</note>1. CAtholicks do not affirm, from God's commanding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Magiſtrate, and to their Laws, That, <hi>therefore</hi> all Diſ-obedience to them, or their Laws, is a mortal Sin. For, ſo, all Diſ-obedience to any of their Laws whatever, tho never ſo light for their matter, would be mortal Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is manifeſt; that many times the matter which theſe Magiſtrates command is antecedently our duty in obedience to ſome Divine Law under Penalty of Mortal Sin, tho they had not commanded it. As in matters of much conſequence to the publick, or our private, good, the Charity to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or alſo to our ſelves, that is commanded by God's Law, requires that, which the Magiſtrate alſo exacts of us. In ſuch caſes, therefore, there may be a great, and mortal Sin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in diſ-obeying the Eccleſiaſtical or Civil Laws, but this by vertue of the Divine concurring with, and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, them in theſe particular Injunctions.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:37764:45"/>
3. Catholicks affirm, That the Breach of a humane Law (made in a thing that is left indifferent by the Divine) out of contempt may be a greater Sin, than breaking one of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precepts out of Infirmity; but this is alſo by vertue of our offending againſt another particular Divine Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting ſuch contempt of the Magiſtrate. But (ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, neglect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet aſide) that a much greater guilt is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily contracted from the breach of a Divine, than only an humane command, both from the greater neceſſity and benefit in general of the matter of the Laws Divine, and from the ſupreme Dignity and Majeſty of the immediate Legiſlator.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Catholicks affirm, That no humane Laws made in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of what conſequence ſoever, do bind beyond the Law-Giver's intention; ſo that ſuch Laws, tho given in matters of greateſt moment, bind not under pain of mortal Sin, (I mean, as they are his Laws) if he doth not intend them to do ſo. In whoſe Power ſince it is to lay no obligation, ſo not to lay the greateſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That whatever obligation to Sin ſuch Laws may have from the Law-givers intention, yet that, in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they may not bind at all (as the Divine do); as, <hi>in Periculo mortis; cum pergravi damno, aut infamia,</hi>  for <hi>quod valde difficile moraliter impoſſibile;</hi> and to Impoſſibles Laws bind not. I ſay, if the thing commanded appear not of a greater conſequence, than ſuch private damage, nor hath been expreſſed by the Magiſtrate to be eſteemed ſo. Otherwiſe it is preſumed that the Law-Giver, in that Charity which he oweth to his Subjects, doth, or ought to, paſs his Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention that they ſhould bind under Sin in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moſt of the Church's Laws are paſſed without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration of her Subjects incurring mortal Sin in the Breach of them (yet this rationally collected by her Doctors from the great conſequence of the matter commanded, the heavy puniſhment annexed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And ſometimes her Laws are ſo indulgent, as to oblige to a Penalty only, without any Guilt laid upon the Tranſgreſſor of them.</p>

               <p>After that, this is agreed on alſo by Proteſtants; that theſe two go always together, and that none is reconciled or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into God's favour by remiſſion of Sin, who is not alſo, at the ſame time, renewed in his mind, and made righteous by infuſion of the Holy Spirit. β.</p>

Where we are ſaid to be <hi>juſtified freely</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing in us deſerving it] <hi>by his Grace</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> infuſed, as all grant it is, at that time when God juſtifies us.] <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>ver.</hi> Where ſpeaking of Baptiſme, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That according to his mercy he ſaved us by the laver of regeneration, and renovation</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> internal] <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt; that being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Grace</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> in this internal renovation <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>we ſhould be made Heirs of eternal life.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. compared with the former; where ſpeaking of the ſame Baptiſme he ſaith, <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the name of the Lord Jeſus</hi> [into which they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized] <hi>and by the Spirit of God</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> infuſed in our Baptiſme; by which infuſed we are ſaid here expreſly, as to be ſanctified, ſo juſtified; and this put the laſt, as alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. it is put alone, but there neceſſarily including alſo our Sanctification.] <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. Where Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>delivered for our offences</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> the remiſſion of them], and to be <hi>raiſed again for our justification</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> for our regeneration or renovation by the Spirit given unto us upon his Reſurrection] comp. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24.

And that Grace reigneth [<hi>i. e.</hi> in us] by [or thr] Juſtice to life eternal. It were needleſs to add more. To the ſame matter belong all thoſe Texts, wherein we are ſaid, <hi>By being born again, and by inherent righteouſneſs, to be made</hi> Friends, Domeſticks, Children, <hi>Heirs of God.</hi> All thoſe Texts which atribute Salvation, or alſo remiſſion of Sin, or puniſhment, either to the ſeveral particular habits and branches of this inherent Righteouſneſs (as to that of Faith, of Hope, or Charity, of the Love, or Fear, or Service of God; or Love, Mercy, and Alms to our Neighbour); or to the ſeveral Act:

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37764:47"/>To which may be added, that there being two things very conſiderable in Sin; the tranſient act, and the remaining habit; of which the later is far the worſe; and of which it is neceſſary, that the one be deleted, as well as the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, for any one to be accounted poſitively juſt, or not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; this later (the habit) is not removed or aboliſhed, but by Grace firſt infuſed; and alſo, whether before, or rather after the ſame Grace infuſed, our former actual Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, is thought by Proteſtants a thing doubtful, and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be decided.δ.</p>

               <p>This infuſion of Grace therefore, by ſeveral titles, claims the chief place in our Juſtification, and is that thing only in us that juſtifieth or maketh us to be really juſt; and ſo is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtiled the formal cauſe of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Not all the benefit and effect in ſuch a manner, as that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is any way due to the active or paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is thus due to us: (for ſo we ſhould all receive a future reward equal to one another; and alſo equal to that of Chriſt our Lord's); but all that benefit and effect of them, which our ſinful condition ſtands in need of; and which God hath further thought fit to diſpence, for the purchaſing, (by an equal compenſation and ſatisfaction) of our preſent pardon and future Glory. The benefit and reward of which merits, as to our glorification, he applies variouſly, according to the different degrees of our own preſent ſanctity and good works, that diſpoſe us for ſuch a participation of theſe Merits.

But this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be remembred; that no worth of the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is from our ſelves, as of our ſelves; but the worth of them is from God. They affirm, accordingly, that there is in theſe Works of the juſtified, proceeding in us from this Divine Principle, a worth and ſimilitude ſome way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and correſponding to the reward promiſed to them; in reſpect of which worth, Life eternal, and the beatifical Viſion of God, and all the conſequences thereof, are called the Wages, and Stipend, Reward, Prize, and Crown, of theſe Works; <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.8. —2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.10. —1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25. And they ſaid truly to merit ſuch reward, according to the ſenſe of the word <hi>Merit</hi> uſed by the Fathers, and the word <hi>Dignity</hi> uſed in the Scriptures. (a chief portion of which reward, as a greater meaſure of God's Spirit; and Charity, and Sanctification in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe degree, received in the next world; and the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Grace daily received in this, are only higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the ſame kind, and nature, with that, of which they are the reward.) And God alſo is ſaid to give ſuch rewards to theſe, <hi>ex juſtitia; &amp; quia digni ſunt,</hi> (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 3, 4. —2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. —2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.) not only in this reſpect that God is juſt and faithful in keeping his promiſe, once made, tho to a Service of little or no worth at all; but in reſpect of ſome valuable goodneſs, and worth (tho this from God) alſo in the <hi>condition</hi> it ſelf, to which he makes the promiſe of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37764:58"/>ſuch reward. They rationally affirm alſo, that whatever benefit any ones Sanctity or good Works may be ſaid; by way of impetration, to procure from God for others, they may be ſaid alſo to have the ſame power with God for themſelves, when by relapſe into ſin, or falling into any neceſſity or miſery themſelves are in the ſame condition as ſuch others; and when their ingratitude, and affront and contempt of former Grace <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not aggravate their offence and fall beyond that of others. See 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13, 14.22.31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly,</hi> Yet this worth of the Righteouſneſs, or works of the juſtified, whatever it it be, as it hath its original not from us, but from God, and is alſo, without any purchaſe thereof, wholly due to him, from us his Creatures and Vaſſals; ſo is it not affirmed to aſcend ſo high, as any way to equal thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promiſed to it, but to be far inferior, and God ever to reward beyond any ſuch Merit. (<hi>Matt.</hi> 25.22. —2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) For whereas our good Works momentary are not only ſaid to merit Life eternal, but alſo to merit thoſe higher meaſures of the Holy Spirit, and degrees of Sanctification, that ſhall be conferred on us there, as alſo the the increaſe of Grace, in this life; here it is manifeſt, that the leſſer degree (the Merit); and the greater, (the reward) cannot be equalled in their worth. Some proportion, ſome ſimilitude there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Seed the juſtified ſow here, and the Fruits thereof they reap hereafter, ſufficient to ſupport the Phraſe (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after the intervening of a Pact) of the one meriting, or being worthy of the other; but not to maintain in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative juſtice, one of equal value, or worth, to the other α. This we have title to by Chriſt's <hi>Merits</hi> only, not our Works; to the which <hi>Merits</hi> alſo we owe, that we have theſe Works; therefore the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that admits <hi>meritum bonorum operum ex pacto,</hi> and ſo <hi>ex juſtitia &amp;c,</hi> yet waves the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ex condigno,</hi> as liable to Miſtakes. ε.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concerning Sin Venial and Mortal.</note>THE Catholick Doctrine is. 1. That all the Baptized are truely Regenerate. 2. That a Man falls not from this ſtate of Regeneration, or from God's Grace, and favour by committing any Sin, how ſmall ſoever; nor yet continues ſtill in this State whilſt committing any Sin how great ſoever. But <hi>3ly,</hi> that there are ſome greater crimes, and offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, which are inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive of, the State of Grace; which do ſo break God's Commandments, as that (if not worthily repented of) they make us actually liable to eternal Damnation; after the committing of which (expelling us from the Grace and Priviledges of our Baptiſme) we cannot be reconciled to God, nor reſtored to our former condition, without the help of the Keys of the Church (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this may be had.) Laſtly, from which Sins by the Grace of God the Regenerate Perſon may totally abſtain and totally reform his life, and in reſpect of them may, through his whole life, perfectly obſerve all God's Commandments. <hi>4ly,</hi> That there are other leſſer Sins, which are well conſiſtent with the State of Regeneration. From committing of which (one or other of them) no man, tho Regenerate (abſtracting from God's ſpecial Priviledge) can for any long time live free; nor in reſpect of theſe can be ſaid perfectly to obſerve God's Commandments. <hi>Bellarm. de amiſs Gratiae</hi> upon <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Si quis leviter iraſcitur</hi> [which he calls a Venial Sin] <hi>is jam recedit a perfecta obſervatione legis. Si quis autem manifeſtum convitium in proximum jactat, is demum non a perfecta obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, ſed ſimpliciter ab obſervatione legis recedit.</hi> Which Sins, however they do, or do not, offend againſt God's Laws; or alſo, in their nature, do, or do not merit eternal puniſhments, yet all agree on this, that no Regenerate perſon at all by committing them, doth actually fall from God's favour, or his former righteouſneſs; nor actually incur external puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37764:61"/>and that the Regenerate, committing them, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at leaſt an habitual repentance of them.</p>

               <p>Maintain; that there are ſeveral ſuch Counſels, or Precepts of perfection, in Scripture, which are not Precepts of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obedience; and which, being obſerved, are graciouſly accepted, and highlier rewarded; but not obſerved, bring on us no guilt of ſin, or liability to puniſhment; laſtly, in doing which we do more than is commanded; <hi>viz.</hi> in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matter, concerning which the Counſel is; and which are free-will-offerings and <hi>indebita, i. e.</hi> upon any Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting them ſo of us, as that, in the omiſſion of them, we are held tranſgreſſors of it; <hi>i. e.</hi> Sinners. For tho God, whoſe are we and all ours, might juſtly require theſe works alſo under ſuch penalties: yet ſuch is his indulgence, that he calls not for all his dues from us on ſuch terms, nor ties us in every thing, under the pain of ſinning, or incurring his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to do our beſt: for, then, he, that did not his beſt, could not poſſibly do well, nor any one better than well: contrary to the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.38. and whoever can be any whit better, ſhould be yet bad. Such works in <hi>Conſilio</hi> are the higheſt degrees in the acts of Chriſtian Virtues, or Duties; which Virtues conſiſt not in an indiviſible point, but have a certain Latitude, as there muſt be ſome loweſt degree, as to time how often, or quantity how much, farther than which he, that deſcends, ſinneth againſt the Precept, ſo are there certain higher degrees, as to time, place, or quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which for encouraging our beſt endeavours, are by the Divine Wiſdome, allowed, commended, or (if you will) required, upon the title of perfection. Laſtly, which are highly rewarded; but out of his mercy to our weakneſs, not ſtrictly commanded upon the forfeiture of our being any longer good, or virtuous; nor the omiſſion of them puniſhed. <hi>2ly,</hi> That hence clearly appears a degree of perfection in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37764:65"/>obſervance of the Counſel always tranſcending that of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Precept, to which ſuch Counſel relates: becauſe theſe (ſuch as are called Supererogatory) are always the more intenſive and heroical acts of the ſame Virtues, or Duties. ε.</p>

               <p>So there is a higher degree of perfection <hi>(caeteris paribus) i. e.</hi> as to good intentions, and the improvements made by the external acts on the inward habits, and our keeping ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the latitude of the Virtue ſuppoſed a like in both; in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing the fifth, than only the tenth part of our increaſe or goods, in alms to the poor; or giving dayly what another doth weekly; in praying ſeven times, than twice, a day, or with greater fervour than is that leaſt degree thereof, which may be performed without ſinning; In an entire faſting, than temperate eating; and in a total abſtinence from, than a moderate uſe of, delicate meats; or faſting four times, than only twice a week; in a virginal than a conjugal Chaſtity; preaching for nothing (whereby the more to advance the Goſpel) than for wages; preaching once a day, (i. e. <hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) than once a week.

               <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> 2, 2. <hi>q.</hi> 184. art. 3. ſpeaks thus in anſwer to the Argument. <hi>Ad obſervationem praeceptorum omnes tenentur, cum ſit de neceſſitate ſalutis; &amp; igitur perfectio Chriſtianae vitae non conſiſtit in praeceptis, quia omnes ad perfectionem non tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> That, —<hi>Non eſt tranſgreſſor praecepti</hi> [perfectae dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis] <hi>qui non attingit ad medios perfectionis gradus, dummodo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingit ad infimum.</hi> [Which lower degree every juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be poſſeſſed of before performing Counſels.] <hi>Eſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>alia perfectio charitatis</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> the higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, that tranſcend the Precept] <hi>ad quam aliquis per aliquid ſpirituale augmentum pervenit</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> by practiſing and uſing the advantage of Counſels] <hi>ut puta, cum homo etiam a rebus licitis abſtineat, ut liberius divinis Obſequiis Vacet.</hi>

               <p>So the very higheſt Degree, that of perfect Dilection <hi>[Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde &amp; totis viribus]</hi> doth not command, under pain of ſinning, and puniſhment, an entire employment of all our powers, thoughts and affections on God, wholly, perpetually; nor that we never love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or think on any thing beſides him (Proteſtants aſſenting); but only ſuch a ſincerity of our love, <hi>ut nihil ſupra eum, aequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ei diligatur;</hi> Beyond which there may be yet a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe dilection of him <hi>in Conſilio,</hi> and moſt acceptable to God, to which we ſtand upon no ſuch penalty obliged. ζ.

               <p>Neither, ſince the regained amity of God, and remiſſion of eternal torments is infinitely more valuable than the remiſſion of the temporal, can it be imagined; but that God requires theſe our Humiliations, and Mortifications, as well for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
